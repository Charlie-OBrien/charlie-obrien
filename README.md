I am a graduate of New Brunswick Community College's Information Technology: Programmer Analyst program. I have 3 years of experiance as a Full Stack Developer. Feel free to brows my repos. Some of them are simple "cheat sheet" style projects that I refer back to when I am stuck or when I need a simple project to use as a template for my own learning.   

Skills: React, React Native, JavaScript, .Net, MongoDB, SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Java

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new project with [Civic Tech Fredericton](https://www.civictechfredericton.com/)
